        "| Criterion | Summary assessment | Rating | Justification for any ratings’ changes due to validation | EOU Validated Rating |\n|---|---|---|---|---|\n| **Strategic Relevance** |  |  |  |  |\n| 1. Alignment to UNEP MTS, POW and strategic priorities | Excellent alignment | **HS** | The rating is corrected from HS to S in accordance with the weighted rating of the three sub-criteria under Strategic Relevance. | **S** |\n| 2. Alignment to Donor/Partner strategic priorities | Very good alignment | **HS** | The rating is validated. | **HS** |\n| 3. Relevance to global, regional, sub-regional and national environmental priorities | Relevance varied but overall was Satisfactory | **S** | The rating is validated. | **S** |\n| 4. Complementarity with relevant existing interventions/coherence | HS complementarity, but it was underutilized. (Pending reassessment) | **MS** | The rating is validated. | **MS** |\n| **Quality of Project Design** |  |  |  |  |\n|  | Design based on successful BEA projects, but TOC lacked some relevant market elements of ZCBs | **S** | The rating is validated. The EOU notes that, according to evidence presented in the review report, the project design had weaknesses in its TOC and lacked ‘smart’ stakeholder-related indicators at output and outcome levels in the logical framework and monitoring. | **S** |\n| **Nature of External Context** | Global pandemic of SARS COVID-19 and earthquake in Türkiye were challenging | **MU** | The rating is validated. | **MU** |\n| **Effectiveness** |  |  |  |  |\n|  | Outputs were high quality, available and well-utilized but should have been gathered together in one public access point by end of project | **HS** | The rating is validated. However, the assessment does not provide evidence of availability of outputs against baseline and indicator targets. The outputs that were delivered and assessed in the review appear to be of good quality. | **HS** |\n| 1. Availability of outputs |  | **S** |  | **S** |\n| 2. Achievement of project outcomes | Targets for outcomes were exceeded | **HS** | The rating is validated based on the evidence presented. While targets for outcomes were exceeded, the lack of evidence provided on delivery of all outputs versus delivery of key outputs weakens the causal narrative underpinning the outcome assessment. | **HS** |\n| 3. Likelihood of impact | Difficult to project, given lack of emissions data and long timeline(post-2030) for assumptions and drivers to hold for multiple countries | **ML** | The rating is validated. In addition to the justification provided by the reviewer, there are key assumptions and drivers identified in the discussion in the conclusions sections which are not addressed. | **ML** |\n| **Financial Management** |  |  |  |  |\n| 1. Adherence to UNEP’s financial policies and procedures | All policies and procedures followed | **HS** | The rating is corrected from HS to S in accordance with the weighted rating of the three sub-criteria under Financial Management. | **S** |\n| 2. Completeness of project financial information | Nearly complete, except for final audit (underway) and PM’s explanation for one budget shortfall (IFC in-kind contribution) | **MS** | The rating is validated. | **MS** |\n| 3. Communication between finance and project management staff | Regular, frequent and satisfactory; FMO and TM well informed. See above for outstanding PM items | **S** | The rating is validated. | **S** |\n| **Efficiency** | Implemented fully within timeframe (with well-justified no cost 7-month extension for MU nature of external context) | **HS** | The rating is revised from HS to S. The project had one no-cost extension. The project was implemented over the period 2021-2023 after the Covid-19 onset. Although the extension was justified by external factors in Turkey, the increased cost of project management remains. | **S** |\n| **Monitoring and Reporting** |  |  |  |  |\n| 1. Monitoring design and budgeting | Plan fully developed and designed with sufficient budget and indicators and owned by UNEP TMs and WRI PMs. | **HS** | The rating is revised reflecting a lack of adequate and smart indicators disaggregated by relevant stakeholder groups for measuring results, especially at outcome level and towards impact. . | **S** |\n| 2. Monitoring of project implementation | Plan fully developed and conducted in a timely manner by TMs and PMs. Some reporting revisions made for no-cost time extension. | **S** | The rating is validated. | **S** |\n| 3. Project reporting | Reports match other evidence examined during TR; PM submitted detailed reports of stakeholder engagement and outreach (disaggregated by gender) | **HS** | The rating is validated. | **HS** |\n| **Sustainability** |  |  |  |  |\n| 1. Socio-political sustainability | Near-term is likely, but longer term is highly dependent upon each country’s, state’s or city’s political commitments, continuity of governance and increased capabilities | **ML** | The rating is validated. | **ML** |\n| 2. Financial sustainability | Near-term, partially reliant upon international support. Long-term, the ZCB approach must demonstrate value to the financial sector in each locality and level of governance. | **ML** | The rating is validated. | **ML** |\n| 3. Institutional sustainability | ZCB advocacy by UNEP, WRI and other partners likely will persist under their respective programs, possibly driven by the Buildings Breakthrough, GlobalABC and other UNEP and UNFCCC efforts. | **L** | The rating is validated. | **L** |\n| **Factors Affecting Performance** |  |  |  |  |\n| 1. Preparation and readiness | All conditions met; first disbursement within 6 months. | **HS** | The overall rating of factors is validated. | **HS** |\n|  |  | **HS** | The rating is validated. Timeliness and engagement was supported by an experienced implementing partner and a project well situated in a nest of other EE projects. | **HS** |\n| 2. Quality of project management and supervision | Good communication maintained virtually by both parties, including smooth transitions during staff turnovers. | **HS** | The rating is validated. | **HS** |\n| 2.1 UNEP/Implementing Agency: |  | **HS** | The rating is validated. | **HS** |\n| 2.2 Partners/Executing Agency: |  | **HS** | The rating is validated. | **HS** |\n| 3. Stakeholders’ participation and cooperation | High degree of participation, exceeding targets for number of participants and balanced gender participation | **HS** | The rating is validated. | **HS** |\n| 4. Responsiveness to human rights and gender equality | Consideration given to gender equality throughout project activities, outputs and outcomes. Human rights issues addressed in discussions of informal building sector | **HS** | The rating is revised from HS to S. Moderate human rights and gender considerations demonstrated in project activities through the use of WRI tools and guides with focus on gender inclusion. Some gender sensitivity was demonstrated during implementation with “gender-balanced participation of donors” (paragraph 169). | **S** |\n| 5. Environmental and social safeguards | Safeguarding and risks well considered and monitored; no negative environmental impacts | **S** | Rating is validated. See also Annex III, for more details on the management of safeguards. | **S** |\n| 6. Country ownership and driven-ness | High degree of country and subnational ownership and driven-ness demonstrated, with many local-level ZCB policy & building efforts continuing post project | **HS** | The rating is validated. | **HS** |\n| 7. Communication and public awareness | Good awareness at local stakeholder level; global audience communication could have been improved (lacks central access point for resources, post-project; this could negatively impact ease of ZCB project replication) | **MS** | The rating is validated. | **MS** |\n| **Overall Project Performance Rating** |  | **HS**, especially considering diverse locations, short timeframe, medium-size project (& budget) and unanticipated external context (prolonged pandemic & a major earthquake) | **HS** | The overall rating is corrected based on the weighted rating scale of evaluation criteria. | **S** |\n| **Lessons learned** |  |  |  |  |\n|  |  |  |  |  |\n|  |  |  |  |  |\n|  |  |  |  |  |\n|  |  |  |  |  |\n|  |  |  |  |  |\n|  |  |  |  |  |\n|  |  |  |  |
